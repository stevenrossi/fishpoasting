The flow meter centered in the mouth of the net measures the amountof water flowing through the fine-meshed cone, and from this an estimate of theabundance of zooplankton can be made.

Artwork depicting closed-cycle underwater breathing system, designed and builtby General Electric's Re-entry adn Environmental Systems Division.  This systemwill be used for the first time in underwater research in the Tektite II Program.  This system can operate for up to six hours and does not generate bubbleslike conventional scuba, thus enabling inconspicuous marine life observations.
