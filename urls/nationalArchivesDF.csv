The train, carrying 275 passengers on its afternoon trip from New York City to Boston, was impeded by the hurricane, which had littered the tracks with the debris of fishing boats, houses and collapsed buildings.  The precariously leaning passenger cars in the foreground of the photograph demonstrate how the hurricane force winds and rising waters had threatened to destroy the rail bed and wash away the train.  Two passengers drowned in an attempt to escape to safety.  Eventually, the Bostonian's crew cleared the rails sufficiently to guide the train into Stonington.""","Department of Defense.
